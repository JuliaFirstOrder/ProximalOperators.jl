# In several cases, the prox with respect to some function can be expressed
# in terms of the prox of some other function. One example of this is a norm
# vs. the indicator of the dual norm ball. More in general, Moreau identity.
#
# Still, in some of these cases it may be convenient, from the computational
# point of view, to write the prox of a function from scratch rather than
# reusing existing code. It is safe then to test the proximal mappings of
# closely related functions against each other.
