# Demos

The [demos folder](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl/tree/master/demos/) contains examples on how to use the functions of ProximalOperators to implement optimization algorithms. **Warning:** Make sure that the version of ProximalOperators that you have installed is up-to-date with the demo script you are trying to run, as the package features may change over time and the [master branch](https://github.com/kul-forbes/ProximalOperators.jl/tree/master) be ahead of what you have installed.
